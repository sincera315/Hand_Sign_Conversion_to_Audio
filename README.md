## Overview

This project converts sign language gestures into text using machine learning models and computer vision techniques. The recognized text is then converted into audio output for easy communication. 

## Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Detect and recognize hand gestures using computer vision.
- **Text Conversion**: Translates recognized gestures into meaningful text.
- **Audio Conversion**: Converts the text output to human-like audio.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for real-time input and output.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (for gesture recognition model)
  - gTTS or pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech conversion)
  - NumPy
  - Flask or Streamlit (optional, for the interface)

## Usage

### Start the application:

```bash
python main.py
```
##Workflow
-Input: Live camera feed or uploaded video of sign language.
-Gesture Recognition: Detect hand gestures and translate them into text using the trained model.
-Text-to-Audio Conversion: Convert the recognized text into audio using a text-to-speech engine.
-Output: Play the generated audio to the user.
